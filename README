 Assignment 5 - .oil file

 This program was completed using pair programming.
 Partner: Elizabeth Cepernich (eceperni@ucsc.edu)
 Partner: Leah Langford (llangfor@ucsc.edu)

 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
 at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

 Elizabeth Cepernich spent 2 hours working alone.
 Leah Langford spent 2 hours working alone.
 We spent 10 hours working together.
 Elizabeth Cepernich spent 7 hours driving.
 Leah Langford spent 3 hours driving.

 Please grade the work submitted by eceperni@ucsc.edu
 and not the work submitted by llangfor@ucsc.edu.

 We used bitbucket (git) to share work between our directories when 
 not together. The bitbucket repo can be found here: 
 https://bitbucket.org/leahlang4d/cmps_104a We have made 
 it public, so if you want to look at it, it should be accessible. 

 Last week we didn't complete assignment 4, but since then, we have
 gotten it to compile and run correctly, so the .sym file and the 
 .ast files should now have correct output as well.
