 This program was completed using pair programming.
 Partner: Elizabeth Cepernich (eceperni@ucsc.edu)
 Partner: Leah Langford (llangfor@ucsc.edu)

 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
 at most 25% of an individual’s effort for an assignment should
 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

 Elizabeth Cepernich spent 8 hours working alone.
 Leah Langford spent 6 hours working alone.
 We spent 20 hours working together.
 Elizabeth Cepernich spent 15 hours driving.
 Leah Langford spent 5 hours driving.
